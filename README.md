Project

A GUI-based adventure game where every action is based on the roll of a dice. Step into the world of Valdoria and search for the magical gauntlet for power! Life is a gamble, from quitting the game to fighting off bandits, your every action will depend on the roll of a dice! Can you beat the odds and successfully complete your quest? The dice will decide your fate. The purpose of the never-ending dice rolls is to infuriate the user. We want the user to question if they had any choice in the game. There’s roughly a 50% chance of winning the game, and every action has an opportunity for it to end. At the end, when the user thinks they beat the odds, there’s one more dice roll to determine the fate. Every action is a gamble, and it is completely out of your control. 

Tools used
-Visual Studio Community
-Java
- .NET Windows Forms Application

Testing 
Various manual system tests of both logic and GUI. Errors were documented and addressed. Input Validation built into the software through button inputs only, except for name. 

How To Use
The Wizard that introduces the game will navigate the user through the entire game. In terms of user-decided actions, there aren’t many. The game will decide your actions for you randomly. If you selected an action and it didn’t work, that means the game chose differently. The Wizard will let you know when you win or lose the game, and then the application will close.
